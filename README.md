## Development

### Setup
Have `gulp` installed

Enter `npm start` in one terminal window

Run `gulp` in the root of the project in a different terminal window. This will start the `gulp watch` task, which runs js-hint and builds the project files in the public folder.

Every time a change is made in the client folder, the project will be re-built and placed in the public folder in real-time. One of the tasks automatically run by gulp watcher during this step is `browserify-dev`, which executes very quickly, but produces a huge concatenated js file. Therefore this is suitable (and convenient) only for development purposes. 

### Installing Dependencies

Have bower and node installed.

From within the root directory run:

```
npm install
bower install
```

## Road Map

Questions:
- what database management system are we using?
- are we deploying on Heroku? something else?


Back-end team:
- implement a database
- when a user searches for a senator, check if that person has already been stored
- if not, grab query the api for that person and store it in the database


Stretch:
- research into getting bulk data of bills for keywords
- if we can get the keywords from bulk calls, try storing bills from limited time period (ie last 30 days) for easy keyword-searching
- on user searching for a keyword, query the database for recent bills with that keyword, then store in the database for future searches



Front-end team:
- implement geolocation to find the user's state
- show/suggest senators for that state
- remove 'recent searches'? is that a useful feature? or just place the senators for the user's location above that section
- or combine the two features and make a suggested senators based on location first and last searched second
- maybe start with a naive approach first (just based on location with api call), and then expand it later if we feel it would be worthwhile enough to the user based on the time it would take the implement it

- research development with heroku (any limitations for database/storage?)


Stretch:
- add ui improvements/slight design

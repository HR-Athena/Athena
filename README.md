## Development

### Setup
Have `gulp` installed

Enter `npm start` in one terminal window

Run `gulp` in the root of the project in a different terminal window. This will start the `gulp watch` task, which runs js-hint and builds the project files in the public folder.

Every time a change is made in the client folder, the project will be re-built and placed in the public folder in real-time. One of the tasks automatically run by gulp watcher during this step is `browserify-dev`, which executes very quickly, but produces a huge concatenated js file. Therefore this is suitable (and convenient) only for development purposes. 

### Installing Dependencies

Have bower and node installed.

From within the root directory run:

```
npm install
bower install
```
